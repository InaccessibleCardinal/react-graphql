# react-graphql
Bring down all. Npm install.

Then npm run dev should run both the express server and the react-apollo client. 

React stuff is in the client folder. Express and graphql schema is in the server folder.

Both server and client should be configured for hot reloading.

Both are bare bones and a lot of stuff is mingled together. Just a enough to get wheel turning.
